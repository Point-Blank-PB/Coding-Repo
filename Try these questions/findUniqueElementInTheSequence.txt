Given a sequence of integers. There are 2 types of integers in the sequence 
either repeating or unique. You are told that there is only 1 unique integer
in the sequence. All the repeating integers are repeated odd no. of times(eg 3, 5, 7, etc).
Your task is to find this unique integer in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

eg {2, 2, 2, 5, 6, 5, 5} => answer is 1
